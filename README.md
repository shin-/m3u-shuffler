m3u-shuffler
=========

I love waking up to my own music, and there are cool Android apps out there that will take a playlist and wake you up with it.
But I hate hearing the same song every morning =( So I wrote a node script that discovers all the mp3 files in my music directory and makes a shuffled playlist out of them.

Instructions
========
1. Paste script in root music directory
2. Run `node playlistMaker.js`
3. ?????
4. Profit!
